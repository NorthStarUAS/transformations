## Building

Make sure the build package is installed:

```bash
pip install --upgrade build
```

Build the transformations package

```bash
python -m build
```

## Installation

The build module will create a .whl file in the dist/ directory (double check actual file name in your dist/ directory).

```bash
pip install dist/transformations-2013.6.29-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Documentation and usage

Please refer to the transformations.py file itself for available functions and usage as it is self-documenting.
